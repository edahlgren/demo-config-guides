    The build section contains information on building the demo,
    so someone can build it automatically using preconfigured
    scripts or manually using command-line arguments.
    
  best_practices:
    - "Use preconfigured scripts to execute optimized and debug builds"
    - "Build scripts should show progress if they take longer than several seconds"
    - "The clean script should remove _all_ build artifacts"
