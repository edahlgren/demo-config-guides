    The run section contains information on executing the demo,
    so someone can execute it automatically using preconfigured
    scripts or manually using command-line arguments.
    
  best_practices:
    - "Use the preconfigured scripts to show off the demo's range of functionality"
    - "Keep the execution time of scripts and examples short (max 2-3 minutes)"
    - "Use only 2-3 arguments at a time in command-line examples"
