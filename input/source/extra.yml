    The source section contains information about the source code
    of the demo so someone can read the implementation of the demo
    and modify it.
    
  best_practices:
    - "Use a commit hash as the version, if available"
    - "Include a file containing the license instead of a license name"
    - "Include at least 2-3 notable source files"
    - "Include at least 1 file or script used to build the source code"
